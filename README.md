# LegoHack-POC-
A proof of concept external esp for Roblox. Using signature scans to find player bases and only thing needed to update the hack
is the offsets to the viewmatrix.

## Why?
I'm not really interested in this game much why myself but I've noticed that there are very little cheats for it despite a surprisingly 
high demand for them. Most cheats written for this game are in LUA and are executed through script executers kind of like how we use 
to execute sqf hacks back in the Arma 2 scripting days. These types of hacks are easily detectable if developers know what to look for
and Roblox actively works on security for their game so what about hacks written in pure C++ where are those at?
